# 🧠 Long-Term Memory (LTM) System

**Revolutionary 9D Spatial Memory Architecture for Massive-Scale Semantic Storage**

## 🎯 **Overview**

The LTM (Long-Term Memory) system is a standalone, high-performance spatial memory engine that provides revolutionary 9D semantic clustering for massive-scale memory storage and retrieval. This package contains everything needed for professional memory management applications.

## 🌍 **Project History & Mission**

### **The Journey (2017-2025)**

This revolutionary memory system began as an ambitious vision in **2017** for a detective simulator video game, where the goal was to create semantic lookup systems for real-time conversations with NPCs. However, the project was shelved as LLMs weren't yet powerful enough for coherent dialogue.

The project was **revived in 2023** for a VTuber AI project that never launched, then evolved into its current form for **robotics applications** through **Piece by Piece XR Development Corporation**. The mission: provide ultra-small LLMs with deep, rich real-time learning capabilities without requiring massive supercomputers.

### **🌱 Environmental Mission**

This system is **freely given to the world** because we urgently need new approaches to AI that:
- **Democratize AI performance** - Advanced knowledge without massive computational requirements
- **Reduce environmental impact** - Brute force training is destroying our planet
- **Enable real-world AI** - Practical performance for everyday applications

**We believe AI advancement shouldn't cost the Earth.** 🌍

)

# Get system statistics
stats = api.get_system_statistics()
print(f"Total memories: {stats['database']['total_memories']}")

api.cleanup()
```

## 🚀 **Mass Data Upload**

For bulk data ingestion, use the included mass data uploader:

```bash
# Upload all supported files from a directory

# Upload with custom settings
results = process_mass_data(
    folder_path="/path/to/data",
    db_path="my_knowledge_base.lmdb",
    file_types=['.txt', '.json'],  # Only process specific types
    enable_linking=True,           # Enable semantic relationships
    chunk_size=500                 # Larger chunks for technical docs
)

print(f"Uploaded {results['memories_stored']:,} memories in {results['processing_time']:.1f}s")
```

## 🧠 **Dual Database Architecture** ⭐ **NEW!**

**Revolutionary separation of Knowledge vs Experience databases!**

### **🎯 The Problem Solved**
Traditional single-database approaches mix static reference materials with dynamic personal experiences, leading to:
- **Knowledge contamination** from conversational data
- **Suboptimal access patterns** for different use cases  
- **Difficulty managing** different retention policies

### **💡 Dual DB Solution**
```python
from dual_database_manager import create_dual_ltm

# Initialize dual database system
dual_ltm = create_dual_ltm(
    knowledge_db="reference_materials.lmdb",    # Static knowledge
    experience_db="personal_memories.lmdb",     # Dynamic experiences
    verbose=True
)

# Store static knowledge (books, documentation, facts)
dual_ltm.store_knowledge(
    "Python is a high-level programming language...",
    metadata={"category": "programming", "source": "documentation"}
)

# Store personal experiences (conversations, learned behaviors)
dual_ltm.store_experience(
    "User Sean asked about dual database architecture and was excited about the benefits",
    metadata={"context": "conversation", "user": "Sean", "importance": 0.9}
)

# Intelligent context-aware searching
results = dual_ltm.intelligent_search("What is Python?")
# → Automatically routes to knowledge database

results = dual_ltm.intelligent_search("What did Sean say about databases?")
# → Automatically routes to experience database
```

### **🏗️ Architecture Benefits**

#### **📚 Knowledge Database**
- **Static reference materials**: Books, documentation, facts
- **Mass-loaded**: Using `mass_data_uploader.py`
- **Read-optimized**: Fast lookup and reference
- **Immutable**: Doesn't change during conversations

#### **🧠 Experience Database**  
- **Dynamic personal memories**: Conversations, learned behaviors
- **STM promotion pipeline**: Memories promoted from short-term memory
- **Write-optimized**: Real-time growth with interactions
- **Contextual**: Personal conversation history and preferences

### **🔄 STM → Experience Pipeline**
```python
# Promote important STM memories to long-term experience
stm_memories = [
    {"content": "User mentioned robotics work at Piece by Piece XR", "importance": 0.8},
    {"content": "Sean expressed excitement about environmental AI benefits", "importance": 0.9}
]

results = dual_ltm.promote_stm_to_experience(stm_memories)
print(f"Promoted {results['promoted_successfully']} memories to experience database")
```

### **🎯 Intelligent Search Routing**
The system automatically determines which database(s) to search based on query context:

- **"What is machine learning?"** → Knowledge database (factual query)
- **"What did we discuss yesterday?"** → Experience database (personal query)  
- **"Tell me about Python"** → Both databases (balanced search)

### **📊 Real-World Benefits**
- **✅ Clean separation** of static knowledge vs dynamic experience
- **✅ Prevents contamination** of reference materials  
- **✅ Optimized access patterns** for different use cases
- **✅ Independent scaling** and optimization strategies
- **✅ Different retention policies** for each database type
- **✅ STM integration** with automatic experience promotion

## 🧪 **Testing**

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python comprehensive_ltm_test.py
```

This will:
- Store 50 diverse test memories
- Execute 25 semantic queries
- Report detailed performance metrics
- Clean up test databases automatically

## 🎛️ **Configuration Options**

### **TURBO vs SAFE Mode**
```python
# TURBO Mode - Maximum performance for bulk operations
ltm = EngramManager(turbo_mode=True)

# SAFE Mode - Maximum data safety for production
ltm = EngramManager(turbo_mode=False)  # Default
```

### **Semantic Linking**
```python
# Enable automatic semantic relationship discovery
ltm = EngramManager(enable_linking=True)  # Default

# Disable for faster storage (no relationship mapping)
ltm = EngramManager(enable_linking=False)
```
